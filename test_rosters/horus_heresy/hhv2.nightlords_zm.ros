Instead, all armies, regardless of Faction or size, may only choose to use any or all of the Zone Mortalis Reactions as presented in this supplement during a Zone Mortalis battle or any of the standard Advanced Reactions in the Horus Heresy - Age of Darkness rulebook.

Base Raction Allotment, Additional Reactions and Reaction Limited in Smaller Games.
In games with a total army size of 1,000 points or fewer per player, any player may make one (1) Reaction in each Phase of their opponent&apos;s turn. This number may not be increased in any way. Regardless of any modifications to a player&apos;s Reaction Allotment or special rules granting additional Reactions, the Reactive player may never make more than one(1) Reaction in any single Phase.</characteristic>

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

During the Shooting phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player resolves the Shooting Attack, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Shooting Attack perform a Displace Reaction.

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic. When resolving the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction, all range and line of sight is measured to the Reacting unit’s new position. If, as a result of this movement, no models in the reacting unit are within range or line of sight of any models in the triggering unit, the Active player cannot choose a new target for their Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

During the Assault phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Charge targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player has resolved any Charge Rolls, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Charge perform a Brace Reaction.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>

              <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

• The Few and the Proud: An army may only include a maximum of one model with this special rule per 1,000 points. This counts across all Detachments of an army. Thus, an army that totals at least 1,000 points may include only a single model with the Master of the Legion special rule, and an army that includes at least 2,000 points may include up to two models with the Master of the Legion special rule, etc.
• Retinue: A model with this special rule may also include a Legion Command Squad, Legion Cataphractii Command Squad or Legion Tartaros Command Squad as part of the same Force Organisation slot as the model with the Master of the Legion special rule. The full rules for doing so can be found in the Appendix: Legiones Astartes Special Rules on page 124.</description>

                      <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

Enemy units that are locked in combat are only affected by this modifier if they are locked in combat with the unit that causes Fear. This modifier is not cumulative, and any given unit can only be affected by a single instance of the Fear special rule at a time.This will always be the highest single modifier among those applicable.

A model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear and will still suffer a penalty to its Leadership if within range of an enemy unit that has the Fear special rule.</description>

In addition, an army whose Warlord has this Trait
may make an additional Reaction during the opposing player’s Assault phase as long as the Warlord has not been removed as a casualty. </characteristic>

Twin-linked Blast Weapons
If the Scatter dice does not roll a Hit, you can choose to re-roll the dice when making a Shooting Attack with a Twin-linked Blast weapon. If you choose to do so, you must re-roll both the 2D6 and the Scatter dice.

Twin-linked Template Weapons
Twin-linked Template weapons are fired just like a single weapon, but must re-roll failed To Wound rolls and Armour Penetration rolls.</description>

                      <description>If a model has the Rending special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has the Rending special rule, there is a chance that their close combat attacks will strike a critical blow. For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon’s normal AP value.
Similarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.
In either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weapon’s AP value.
For example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon.</description>

Invulnerable saves granted by a combat shield or boarding shield do not stack with other Invulnerable Saves, but can benefit from rules (like cyber-familiar) that specifically increase existing saves. If a model has another Invulnerable Save then the controlling player must choose which one to use.</characteristic>

              <description>An Apothecarion Detachment is selected as any other unit, using up a single Force Organisation slot and bought in the same manner. However, before the first turn begins and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all models in an Apothecarion Detachment must be assigned to another unit from the same Detachment of the army they were selected as part of. Legion Apothecaries that have not selected a Legion Spatha combat bike or Legion Scimitar jetbike may only be assigned to units composed entirely of models with the Infantry Unit Type and the same Legiones Astartes (X) special rule as the Legion Apothecary, and may not join units that have Terminator armour of any kind. Legion Apothecaries that have selected a Legion Spatha combat bike may only be assigned to units composed entirely of models with Legion Spatha combat bikes and the same Legiones Astartes (X) special rule as the Legion Apothecary, and any Legion Apothecaries that have selected a Legion Scimitar jetbike may only be assigned to units composed entirely of models with Legion Scimitar jetbikes and the same Legiones Astartes (X) special rule as the Legion Apothecary. No Apothecary may be assigned to any unit that includes one or more models with the Independent Character special rule or Unique Sub-type (but such models may join a unit that includes an Apothecary as normal during either deployment or any following turn). No more than one Apothecary may be assigned to any given unit.

Once assigned to a unit, the Legion Apothecary is considered part of that unit and may not leave it under any circumstances – if that unit is removed as a casualty when the Legion Apothecary is removed as well. In battles using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored for removing an Legion Apothecary as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, a Legion Apothecary gains all of the special rules (with the exception of those that specifically forbid it, such as the Bitter Duty special rule) and Unit Sub-types listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any additional Wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

When determining if a unit is outnumbered, models with the Bulky (X) special rules count as a number of models equal to the value included as part of that special rule. Models with the Vehicle Unit Type count as ten models for the purposes of determining if the model is outnumbered by another unit.</description>

• Any Hits inflicted by a Primarch, as part of either Shooting Attacks or in close combat, are allocated by the Primarch’s controlling player and not the controlling player of the target unit. These Hits should form a separate Wound Pool.

              <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic.

If, as a result of this movement, no models in the reacting unit are within range or line of sight of any models in the triggering unit, the Active player cannot choose a new target for their Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

During the Assault phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Charge targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player has resolved any Charge Rolls, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Charge perform a Brace Reaction.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>
