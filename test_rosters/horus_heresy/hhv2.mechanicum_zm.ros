Instead, all armies, regardless of Faction or size, may only choose to use any or all of the Zone Mortalis Reactions as presented in this supplement during a Zone Mortalis battle or any of the standard Advanced Reactions in the Horus Heresy - Age of Darkness rulebook.

Base Raction Allotment, Additional Reactions and Reaction Limited in Smaller Games.
In games with a total army size of 1,000 points or fewer per player, any player may make one (1) Reaction in each Phase of their opponent&apos;s turn. This number may not be increased in any way.

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

During the Shooting phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player resolves the Shooting Attack, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Shooting Attack perform a Displace Reaction.

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic. When resolving the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction, all range and line of sight is measured to the Reacting unit’s new position. If, as a result of this movement, no models in the reacting unit are within range or line of sight of any models in the triggering unit, the Active player cannot choose a new target for their Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

During the Assault phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Charge targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player has resolved any Charge Rolls, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Charge perform a Brace Reaction.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>

              <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

• Opus Viscera: If a model with the Battlesmith (X) special rule in a Detachment that includes a model with this special rule is in base contact with at least one model in a unit comprised of only models with the Infantry Unit Type during the Shooting phase, they can attempt to enhance that unit instead of making a Shooting Attack. Roll a D6. If the result is equal to or more than the value listed in brackets as part of the Battlesmith (X) rule, then one of the following effects may be applied to the unit this model is in base contact with:
- Restore a lost Wound. This will not return a model that has been previously removed from the battle.
- The unit may immediately move a number of inches equal to twice the Initiative Characteristic of the majority of models in the unit. This movement is not Running, and therefore, if the unit did not Run in the Movement phase, it may still make Shooting Attacks and declare a Charge as normal for the remainder of the turn.

• The Sanguine Hook: A model with this special rule gains the Ephemera Lacyraemarta Cybertheurgic Arcana, but may not select any other Cybertheurgic Arcana from those available with the Cybertheurgist special rule.</description>

These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

                      <description>Template weapons are indicated by having the word ‘Template’ for their range instead of a number. Instead of rolling To Hit, simply place the template so that its narrow end is touching the base of the firing model, or the end of the firing weapon’s barrel for Vehicle models without bases, and the rest of the template covers as many models in the target unit as possible, without touching any other friendly models (including other models from the firing model’s unit). Any models fully or partially under the template are hit. Against Vehicles, the template must be placed to cover as much of the Vehicle as possible without touching a friendly model. The position of the firer is used to determine which armour Facing is hit (see page 207). A Template weapon never hits the model firing it.

Template weapons have the Ignores Cover and Wall of Death special rules. Wounds inflicted by Template weapons are allocated following the normal rules.

Multiple Templates
If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Template type, resolve each shot, one at a time, as described above, determining and recording how many Hits are scored by each template. Once the number of Hits from all templates has been determined, roll To Wound as normal.

Wall of Death
Template weapons can fire Snap Shots at any non-Flyer target. If a Template weapon fires as a Snap Shot, it automatically inflicts D3 Hits on the target unit, resolved at its normal Strength and AP value, as long as the target unit either has at least one model within 8&quot; or if the target unit is resolving a Charge against the unit making the Shooting Attack. If the weapon is also a Hellstorm weapon then it instead inflicts D6 Hits.

Hellstorm Weapons
Hellstorm weapons have the word ‘Hellstorm’ instead of a range on their weapon profile. Hellstorm weapons use the Hellstorm template (see page 152), but otherwise obey the rules for other Template weapons.</description>

                      <description>If a model or weapon has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armour penetration when targeting a Vehicle model, or, when targeting a model with the Automata or Dreadnought Unit Type, re-rolls all failed rolls To Wound instead. These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

If a unit has become Pinned and then gains the Fearless special rule,all the effects of being Pinned are immediately cancelled.</description>

              <description>The following rules apply to all models with the Cybernetica Unit Sub-type:
• Models with the Cybernetica Unit Sub-type are subject to the Programmed Behaviour provision. During both the controlling player’s Shooting phase and the Charge sub-phase, an Automata unit must attempt a Shooting Attack and/or Charge if there is an enemy unit within range, and must target the closest enemy unit possible that is within its line of sight and is a valid target for a Shooting Attack or Charge. If two or more targets are equally close then the controlling player chooses which will be the target of a Shooting Attack or Charge.
• A model with the Cybernetica Unit Sub-type may fire all weapons they are equipped with in each Shooting Attack they make, including as part of a Reaction where eligible (this rule on its own does not allow units to make Reactions if they would otherwise be prevented from doing so).
• Models with the Cybernetica Unit Sub-type may fire Heavy and Ordnance weapons and count as Stationary even if they moved in the preceding Movement phase, and may declare Charges as normal regardless of any Shooting Attacks made in the same turn.
• Models with the Cybernetica Unit Sub-type ignore any penalties to their Initiative Characteristic when Charging into or through Difficult Terrain or Dangerous Terrain.</description>

                      <description>If a non-Vehicle unit suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from a weapon with the Pinning special rule, it must take a Leadership test once the firing unit has finished its Shooting Attacks for that Phase. This is called a Pinning test. If the unit fails the Test, it is Pinned. As long as the Test is passed, a unit can be called upon to take multiple Pinning tests in a single turn, but only once for each unit shooting at them.

A unit that is affected by any of the following conditions does not take Pinning tests, and if called upon to do so is considered to automatically pass them:
• The unit is locked in combat.
• The unit is already Pinned (the unit remains Pinned, but takes no further Tests).
• The unit is composed entirely of Vehicle models.
• The unit is Embarked on a Transport Vehicle.
• The target unit is affected by the Fearless special rule.

A unit that has become Pinned cannot Move, Run or Charge. It can only fire Snap Shots if it attacks during the Shooting phase and cannot make Reactions in any Phase. At the end of its following turn, the unit returns to normal and the unit is free to act as normal from then on. Whilst it is Pinned, a unit is affected normally by enemy actions (for example, it takes Morale checks as normal). If the unit is forced to move, for example if it has to Fall Back, it returns to normal immediately. If assaulted, the unit will fight as usual, but because they are not set to receive the Charge, enemy units do not receive the Initiative penalty for assaulting a unit in Difficult Terrain (sec page 222), even if the unit is in Difficult Terrain. If a unit becomes Pinned during a Charge, then that Charge automatically fails. Units that are locked in combat cannot be Pinned and do not take Pinning tests.</description>

                      <description>When firing a Blast weapon, models do not roll To Hit. Instead, pick one enemy model visible to the firer and place the Blast (3&quot;) marker with its hole entirely over the base of the target model, or its hull if the target is a Vehicle. The hole at the centre of the marker must be within the weapon’s Maximum Range. You cannot place the Blast marker so that the base or hull of any friendly model is even partially under it.

The large area affected by the blast means it is going to be very hard to miss completely. Nonetheless, the shot might not land exactly where intended. Roll for the Blast marker to scatter and subtract the firer’s Ballistic Skill from the distance (if any) that it scatters, to a minimum of 0&quot;. Note that it is possible, and absolutely fine, for a shot to scatter beyond the weapon’s Maximum or Minimum Range and line of sight. This represents the chance of ricochets, the missile blasting through cover and other random events. In these cases, Hits are worked out as normal and can hit and Wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the battlefield’s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded.

Once the final position of the Blast marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above – each unit suffers one Hit for each of the models included in that unit that is fully or partially beneath the Blast marker, even if those models are not within the firer’s line of sight.

Once the number of Hits inflicted on the unit has been worked out, roll To Wound and Save as normal. Note that, unlike other attacks, Wounds inflicted by an attack with the Blast special rule can be allocated to any models in the target unit, even if they are out of sight of any models from the attacking unit.

Multiple Blasts
If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described above and determine how many Hits are scored with each individual Blast marker. After the last shot, add up the total number of Hits scored and roll all of the To Wound rolls as normal.

Blast Weapons and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a Blast weapon, the player must re-roll both the Scatter dice and the 2D6. Note that this applies only to models able to fully re-roll a To Hit roll, not to models that may re-roll To Hit rolls of a specific value – for example, models that can re-roll To Hit rolls of a ‘1’ cannot re-roll either the Scatter dice or 2D6 unless another rule allows them to do so.

Blast Weapons and Snap Shots
Blast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.

Large Blast
Large Blast weapons use the 5&quot; Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.

Massive Blast
Massive Blast weapons use the 7&quot; Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.

Apocalyptic Blast
Apocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10&quot; Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.

Apocalyptic Mega-blast (5&quot;/7&quot;/10&quot;)
Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons use the Apocalyptic Blast marker. They obey the rules for Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:

Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons have three Strength values and three AP values. Correspondingly, the Apocalyptic Blast marker is divided into three zones, as shown in the diagram on the next page, one for each Strength and AP value.

The Strength and AP of any Hits depends on the zone in which the target model is located. The first Strength and AP value are used for the inner zone, the second Strength and AP value are used for the middle zone, and the third Strength and AP value are used for the outer zone. Always use the best Strength and AP if a model straddles two or more zones. If a unit has models in several zones, work out the Hits inflicted for each zone separately. Note that there will be a different Wound Pool for each zone.

To determine whether a unit wounded by an Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapon is allowed a Cover Save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the Apocalyptic Blast marker, instead of from the firing model.

Hits from Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons made against Vehicles are always resolved against their Side Armour Value.</description>

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

                  <description>This rule is presented as Hatred (X) where X identifies a specific type of foe. If the special rule does not specify a type of foe, then the unit has Hatred against everyone. This can refer to a Faction or a specific unit. For example, Hatred (Mechanicum) means any model of the Mechanicum Faction, whilst Hatred (Thallax) means only Thallax. A model striking a Hated foe in close combat re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls during the first round of each close combat.

The effects of this special rule only apply when a unit that has it begins an Assault phase not locked in combat and then either Charges or is Charged by an enemy unit. If an enemy unit Charges this unit when it is already locked in combat then that does count as a new ‘first’ turn of combat for the effects of Hatred.</description>

A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 To Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) – this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

                  <description>When a model with this special rule suffers an unsaved Wound, it can make a special Feel No Pain roll to avoid being Wounded (this is a special Saving Throw which is made after unsaved Wounds are suffered).
Feel No Pain rolls may not be taken against unsaved Wounds that have the Instant Death special rule.
Roll a D6 each time an unsaved Wound is suffered. On a result that is equal to or greater than the value in brackets, the unsaved Wound is discounted - treat it as having been saved. On any other result the Wound is taken as normal.
For example, a unit with the special rule Feel No Pain (5+) would need to score a 5 or 6 in order to discount a Wound inflicted upon it.
This is a Damage Mitigation roll - any model may make only a single Damage Mitigation roll of any type for any given Wound (see page 174).</description>

                  <description>This rule is presented as Hatred (X) where X identifies a specific type of foe. If the special rule does not specify a type of foe, then the unit has Hatred against everyone. This can refer to a Faction or a specific unit. For example, Hatred (Mechanicum) means any model of the Mechanicum Faction, whilst Hatred (Thallax) means only Thallax. A model striking a Hated foe in close combat re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls during the first round of each close combat.

The effects of this special rule only apply when a unit that has it begins an Assault phase not locked in combat and then either Charges or is Charged by an enemy unit. If an enemy unit Charges this unit when it is already locked in combat then that does count as a new ‘first’ turn of combat for the effects of Hatred.</description>

In addition to the bonus to move during the Movement phase, a unit equipped entriely with Jet Packts may make an additional move of 6&quot; during the Shooting phase. This move must be taken after the unit has completed any Shooting, is not limited by the weapons fired by that unit during the Shooting phase and ignores terrain and may move over friendly and enemy models/units in the same manner as moves made using a Jet Pack in the Movmeent phase.
Any model equipped with a Jet Pack also gainst the Bulky (2) and Deep Strike special rules, or if it already has the Bulky (2) special rule it gainst the Bulky (3) special rule instead. A unit equipped with Jump PAcks may not Run.
During any Reaction that allows a unit equipped entirely with Jet PAcks to move, increase the distance of that move by 6. This allows the unit to Ignore terrain in the same manner as other Jet Pack moves.</description>

A unit that ends or begins its movement in Dangerous Terrain will still need to take Dangerous Terrain tests as normal, even when employing Incunabulan jet packs and treats Difficult Terrain as Dangerous Terrain. In addition to the bonus to Move during the Movement phase, a unit composed entirely of models with Incunabulan jet packs may make an additional Move of 6&quot; during the Shooting phase. This Move must be taken after the unit has completed any Shooting Attacks, is not limited by the weapons fired by that unit during the Shooting phase and ignores terrain in the same manner as moves made using a Incunabulan jet pack in the Movement phase.
Any model with an Incunabulan jet pack also gains the Bulky (2) and Deep Strike special rules, or if it already has the Bulky (2) special rule it gains the Bulky (3) special rule instead. Models with an Incunabulan jet pack may Embark on models with the Transport Unit Sub-type, contrary to the normal Transport rules, but still must take into account their size due to the Bulky (X) special rule.
During any Reaction that allows a unit to Move, a unit composed entirely of models with Incunabulan jet packs increases the distance of that Move by 6 and allows it to ignore terrain in the same manner as other Incunabulan jet pack moves.</characteristic>

                  <description>If a model has the Rending special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has the Rending special rule, there is a chance that their close combat attacks will strike a critical blow. For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon’s normal AP value.
Similarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.
In either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weapon’s AP value.
For example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon.</description>

This rule has no effect on models that do not have Wounds, such as models with the Vehicle Unit Type.

For example, a model with the Breaching (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound and rolls a result of ‘5’ or higher, the Wound inflicted gains an AP of ‘2’ regardless of the AP value listed on the weapon’s profile. Note that a weapon that has both the Breaching (X) and the Gets Hot special rules always uses the base AP of the weapon when rolls of ‘1’ To Hit inflict Wounds on the attacking model.</description>

                  <description>When firing a weapon that Gets Hot. roll To Hit as normal. For each unmodified To Hit roll of 1, the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) - this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 To Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) – this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

                  <description>If a model or weapon has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armour penetration when targeting a Vehicle model, or, when targeting a model with the Automata or Dreadnought Unit Type, re-rolls all failed rolls To Wound instead. These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

• Any Hits inflicted by a Primarch, as part of either Shooting Attacks or in close combat, are allocated by the Primarch’s controlling player and not the controlling player of the target unit. These Hits should form a separate Wound Pool.

              <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic. When resolving the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction, all range and line of sight is measured to the Reacting unit’s new position.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>
