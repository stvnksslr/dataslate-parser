Instead, all armies, regardless of Faction or size, may only choose to use any or all of the Zone Mortalis Reactions as presented in this supplement during a Zone Mortalis battle or any of the standard Advanced Reactions in the Horus Heresy - Age of Darkness rulebook.

Base Raction Allotment, Additional Reactions and Reaction Limited in Smaller Games.
In games with a total army size of 1,000 points or fewer per player, any player may make one (1) Reaction in each Phase of their opponent&apos;s turn. This number may not be increased in any way. Regardless of any modifications to a player&apos;s Reaction Allotment or special rules granting additional Reactions, the Reactive player may never make more than one(1) Reaction in any single Phase.</characteristic>

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

During the Shooting phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player resolves the Shooting Attack, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Shooting Attack perform a Displace Reaction.

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic. When resolving the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction, all range and line of sight is measured to the Reacting unit’s new position. If, as a result of this movement, no models in the reacting unit are within range or line of sight of any models in the triggering unit, the Active player cannot choose a new target for their Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

During the Assault phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Charge targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player has resolved any Charge Rolls, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Charge perform a Brace Reaction.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>

These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

                  <description>If a model has the Rending special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has the Rending special rule, there is a chance that their close combat attacks will strike a critical blow. For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon’s normal AP value.
Similarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.
In either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weapon’s AP value.
For example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon.</description>

              <description>Models with this special rule gain the following benefits in various situations that involve ‘Nemesis’ units (see the Nemesis unit entry below):
• All models with this special rule gain +1 Attacks when locked in combat with a Nemesis Unit.
• A unit composed entirely of models with this special rule gains an additional bonus of +1 to all Charge rolls made when all targets of the Charge are Nemesis Units.
• When rolling to Hit while Engaged with a Nemesis unit, a model with this special rule will never need to roll better than 4+ to score a Hit – unless the Nemesis unit is composed entirely of models with the Primarch Unit Type, or the attacking model is in a Challenge with a model that has the Primarch Unit Type.

                  <description>If a model or weapon has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armour penetration when targeting a Vehicle model, or, when targeting a model with the Automata or Dreadnought Unit Type, re-rolls all failed rolls To Wound instead. These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

                  <description>If a model or weapon has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armour penetration when targeting a Vehicle model, or, when targeting a model with the Automata or Dreadnought Unit Type, re-rolls all failed rolls To Wound instead. These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

                      <description>Template weapons are indicated by having the word ‘Template’ for their range instead of a number. Instead of rolling To Hit, simply place the template so that its narrow end is touching the base of the firing model, or the end of the firing weapon’s barrel for Vehicle models without bases, and the rest of the template covers as many models in the target unit as possible, without touching any other friendly models (including other models from the firing model’s unit). Any models fully or partially under the template are hit. Against Vehicles, the template must be placed to cover as much of the Vehicle as possible without touching a friendly model. The position of the firer is used to determine which armour Facing is hit (see page 207). A Template weapon never hits the model firing it.

Template weapons have the Ignores Cover and Wall of Death special rules. Wounds inflicted by Template weapons are allocated following the normal rules.

Multiple Templates
If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Template type, resolve each shot, one at a time, as described above, determining and recording how many Hits are scored by each template. Once the number of Hits from all templates has been determined, roll To Wound as normal.

Wall of Death
Template weapons can fire Snap Shots at any non-Flyer target. If a Template weapon fires as a Snap Shot, it automatically inflicts D3 Hits on the target unit, resolved at its normal Strength and AP value, as long as the target unit either has at least one model within 8&quot; or if the target unit is resolving a Charge against the unit making the Shooting Attack. If the weapon is also a Hellstorm weapon then it instead inflicts D6 Hits.

Hellstorm Weapons
Hellstorm weapons have the word ‘Hellstorm’ instead of a range on their weapon profile. Hellstorm weapons use the Hellstorm template (see page 152), but otherwise obey the rules for other Template weapons.</description>

                  <description>You may choose to deploy units that contain at least one model with this special rule last, after all other units (friend and foe) have been deployed. If both players have such units and choose to do so, the players roll off and the winner decides who goes first, then alternate deploying these units.

Units that Infiltrate in this way can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9&quot; from any enemy unit, as long as no deployed enemy unit can draw line of sight to them. This includes in a Building (see page 224), as long as the Building is more than 9&quot; from any enemy unit. Alternatively, they can be set up anywhere on the battlefield more than 12&quot; from any enemy unit, even in plain sight.
If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport, the same rules apply when deploying their Transport.
A unit that deploys using these rules cannot Charge in their first turn.
Having Infiltrate also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Infiltrators that are kept as Reserves (see page 309).

Infiltrate and Scout
If a unit has both the Infiltrate and Scout special rule, that unit can deploy as per the Infiltrate special rule and then redeploy as per the Scout special rule.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.</description>

                  <description>After both sides have deployed (including Infiltrators), but before the first player begins their first turn, a unit containing at least one model with this special rule can choose to redeploy. If the unit is Infantry, Artillery, Dreadnought or Automata, each model can redeploy anywhere entirely within 6&quot; of its current position. If it is any other Unit Type, each model can instead redeploy anywhere entirely within 12&quot; of its current position. During this redeployment, Scouts can move outside the owning player’s Deployment Zone, but must remain more than 9&quot; away from any enemy unit. A unit that makes a Scout redeployment cannot Charge in the first Game Turn. A unit cannot Embark or Disembark as part of a Scout redeployment.

If both sides have Scouts, roll off; the winner decides who redeploys first. Then alternate redeploying Scout units one at a time. If a unit with this special rule is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, it confers the Scout special rule to the Transport (though a Disembarkation cannot be performed as part of the redeployment). Note that a Transport with this special rule does not lose it if a unit without this special rule is Embarked upon it. Having Scout also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Scouts that are kept as Reserves (see page 309).

Infiltrate and Scout
If a unit has both the Infiltrate and Scout special rules, that unit can deploy as per the Infiltrate special rule and then redeploy as per the Scout special rule.</description>

                      <description>If a model has the Rending special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has the Rending special rule, there is a chance that their close combat attacks will strike a critical blow. For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon’s normal AP value.
Similarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.
In either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weapon’s AP value.
For example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon.</description>

• Primarchs are not affected by special rules that negatively modify their Characteristics (other than Wounds) and, in addition, Primarchs always resolve Snap Shots at their normal BS.
• Any Hits inflicted by a Primarch, as part of either Shooting Attacks or in close combat, are allocated by the Primarch’s controlling player and not the controlling player of the target unit. These Hits should form a separate Wound Pool.
• If an army includes any Primarch models, then one of those models must be chosen as the army’s Warlord.</description>

              <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic. When resolving the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction, all range and line of sight is measured to the Reacting unit’s new position. If, as a result of this movement, no models in the reacting unit are within range or line of sight of any models in the triggering unit, the Active player cannot choose a new target for their Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

During the Assault phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Charge targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player has resolved any Charge Rolls, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Charge perform a Brace Reaction.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>
