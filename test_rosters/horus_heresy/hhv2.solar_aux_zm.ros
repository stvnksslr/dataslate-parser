Instead, all armies, regardless of Faction or size, may only choose to use any or all of the Zone Mortalis Reactions as presented in this supplement during a Zone Mortalis battle or any of the standard Advanced Reactions in the Horus Heresy - Age of Darkness rulebook.

Base Raction Allotment, Additional Reactions and Reaction Limited in Smaller Games.
In games with a total army size of 1,000 points or fewer per player, any player may make one (1) Reaction in each Phase of their opponent&apos;s turn. This number may not be increased in any way. Regardless of any modifications to a player&apos;s Reaction Allotment or special rules granting additional Reactions, the Reactive player may never make more than one(1) Reaction in any single Phase.</characteristic>

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

During the Shooting phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player resolves the Shooting Attack, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Shooting Attack perform a Displace Reaction.

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic. When resolving the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction, all range and line of sight is measured to the Reacting unitâ€™s new position. If, as a result of this movement, no models in the reacting unit are within range or line of sight of any models in the triggering unit, the Active player cannot choose a new target for their Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

During the Assault phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Charge targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player has resolved any Charge Rolls, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Charge perform a Brace Reaction.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>

              <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase â€“ once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unitâ€™s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Characterâ€™s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so youâ€™ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weaponâ€™s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

Using grenades does not count as a Shooting Attack and their effects are entirely covered by the rules presented here.

                  <description>An Auxilia Medicae Detachment is selected as any other unit, using up a single Force Organisation slot and bought in the same manner. However, before the first turn begins and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all models in an Auxilia Medicae Detachment must be assigned to another unit from the same Detachment of the army they were selected as part of. Auxilia Medicae may only be assigned to units composed entirely of models with the Infantry Unit Type. No Auxilia Medicae may be assigned to any unit that includes one or more models with the Independent Character special rule or Unique Sub-type (but such models may join a unit that includes an Auxilia Medicae as normal during either deployment or any following turn). No more than one Auxilia Medicae may be assigned to any given unit.

Once assigned to a unit, the Auxilia Medicae is considered part of that unit and may not leave it under any circumstances â€“ if that unit is removed as a casualty then the Auxilia Medicae is removed as well. In games using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored for removing an Auxilia Medicae as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, an Auxilia Medicae gains all of the special rules (with the exception of those that specifically forbid it, such as the Bitter Duty special rule) and Unit Sub-types listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any additional Wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

Feel No Pain rolls may not be taken against unsaved Wounds that have the Instant Death special rule.
Roll a D6 each time an unsaved Wound is suffered. On a result that is equal to or greater than the value in brackets, the unsaved Wound is discounted - treat it as having been saved. On any other result the Wound is taken as normal.
For example, a unit with the special rule Feel No Pain (5+) would need to score a 5 or 6 in order to discount a Wound inflicted upon it.
This is a Damage Mitigation roll - any model may make only a single Damage Mitigation roll of any type for any given Wound (see page 174).</description>

                  <description>An Auxilia Medicae Detachment is selected as any other unit, using up a single Force Organisation slot and bought in the same manner. However, before the first turn begins and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all models in an Auxilia Medicae Detachment must be assigned to another unit from the same Detachment of the army they were selected as part of. Auxilia Medicae may only be assigned to units composed entirely of models with the Infantry Unit Type. No Auxilia Medicae may be assigned to any unit that includes one or more models with the Independent Character special rule or Unique Sub-type (but such models may join a unit that includes an Auxilia Medicae as normal during either deployment or any following turn). No more than one Auxilia Medicae may be assigned to any given unit.

Once assigned to a unit, the Auxilia Medicae is considered part of that unit and may not leave it under any circumstances â€“ if that unit is removed as a casualty then the Auxilia Medicae is removed as well. In games using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored for removing an Auxilia Medicae as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, an Auxilia Medicae gains all of the special rules (with the exception of those that specifically forbid it, such as the Bitter Duty special rule) and Unit Sub-types listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any additional Wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

Feel No Pain rolls may not be taken against unsaved Wounds that have the Instant Death special rule.
Roll a D6 each time an unsaved Wound is suffered. On a result that is equal to or greater than the value in brackets, the unsaved Wound is discounted - treat it as having been saved. On any other result the Wound is taken as normal.
For example, a unit with the special rule Feel No Pain (5+) would need to score a 5 or 6 in order to discount a Wound inflicted upon it.
This is a Damage Mitigation roll - any model may make only a single Damage Mitigation roll of any type for any given Wound (see page 174).</description>

                  <description>An Auxilia Medicae Detachment is selected as any other unit, using up a single Force Organisation slot and bought in the same manner. However, before the first turn begins and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all models in an Auxilia Medicae Detachment must be assigned to another unit from the same Detachment of the army they were selected as part of. Auxilia Medicae may only be assigned to units composed entirely of models with the Infantry Unit Type. No Auxilia Medicae may be assigned to any unit that includes one or more models with the Independent Character special rule or Unique Sub-type (but such models may join a unit that includes an Auxilia Medicae as normal during either deployment or any following turn). No more than one Auxilia Medicae may be assigned to any given unit.

Once assigned to a unit, the Auxilia Medicae is considered part of that unit and may not leave it under any circumstances â€“ if that unit is removed as a casualty then the Auxilia Medicae is removed as well. In games using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored for removing an Auxilia Medicae as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, an Auxilia Medicae gains all of the special rules (with the exception of those that specifically forbid it, such as the Bitter Duty special rule) and Unit Sub-types listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any additional Wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

                      <description>If a model has the Rending special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has the Rending special rule, there is a chance that their close combat attacks will strike a critical blow. For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weaponâ€™s normal AP value.
Similarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.
In either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weaponâ€™s AP value.
For example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon.</description>

A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 To Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) â€“ this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) â€“ this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal.

These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weaponâ€™s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 To Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) â€“ this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) â€“ this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 To Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) â€“ this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

â€¢ Primarchs are not affected by special rules that negatively modify their Characteristics (other than Wounds) and, in addition, Primarchs always resolve Snap Shots at their normal BS.
â€¢ Any Hits inflicted by a Primarch, as part of either Shooting Attacks or in close combat, are allocated by the Primarchâ€™s controlling player and not the controlling player of the target unit. These Hits should form a separate Wound Pool.
â€¢ If an army includes any Primarch models, then one of those models must be chosen as the armyâ€™s Warlord.</description>

              <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase â€“ once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unitâ€™s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Characterâ€™s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so youâ€™ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

However, units containing one or more models with the Fearless special rule cannot use any Reactions that grant a Cover Save, Armour Save or Invulnerable Save, and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless special rule (see page 188). If a unit has become Pinned and then gains the Fearless special rule,all the effects of being Pinned are immediately cancelled.</description>

On a roll equal to or greater than the number in brackets associated with the special rule, that model regains a Wound, or Hull Point, lost earlier in the game.

During the Movement phase, the Reactive player may declare a Reaction if an enemy unit ends a move within 12&quot; and in line of sight of a friendly unit. Once the Active player has completely resolved the movement of their unit, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase in order to have the unit they control that is within 12&quot; and line of sight perform a Suppress Reaction.

Suppress - The Reacting unit may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction and following all the usual rules for Shooting Attacks. A unit that makes a Shooting Attack as part of a Suppress Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight). All Shooting Attacks made as part of a Suppress Reaction are Snap Shots, with the exception of Template Weapons. Note that this prevents models from making attacks with weapons that have the Blast (X) special rule as part of this Reaction. Template Weapons may only be used as part of a Suppress Reaction if the target unit is within 8&quot; and must use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally. Models in the Reacting unit count as Stationary during this Shooting Attack, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase.</characteristic>

During the Shooting phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player resolves the Shooting Attack, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Shooting Attack perform a Displace Reaction.

Displace - Each model in the Reacting unit may move a number of inches up to its unmodified Initiative Characteristic. When resolving the Shooting Attack that triggered this Reaction, all range and line of sight is measured to the Reacting unitâ€™s new position. If, as a result of this movement, no models in the reacting unit are within range or line of sight of any models in the triggering unit, the Active player cannot choose a new target for their Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

During the Assault phase, the Reactive player may react when any enemy unit declares a Charge targeting a unit they control. Before the Active player has resolved any Charge Rolls, the Reactive player may choose to expend their Reaction in that Phase to have the unit targeted by the Charge perform a Brace Reaction.

Brace - The Reacting unit must make a Morale check. If the Check is failed, the Reacting unit immediately Fall Backs 1D6&quot; and automatically regroups when this Fall Back Move is completed. If the Check is successful, the Reacting unit automatically passes any Morale checks they are required to make as a result of losing an assault during the following Fight sub-phase.</characteristic>
